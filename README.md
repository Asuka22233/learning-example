A repository for recording the learning process.


I will frequently update this repository to document my learning process. 

Now, I'm starting to formally study data structures and algorithm analysis. 


Who can help me figure out why, when using the `scanf` scanf function in a `while`while loop for reading an indeterminate number of groups of data in Visual Studio 2022, 
it fails and the program is unable to read any data, 
yet there is no error message?
